- 👋 Hi, I’m @lumberjack001
- 👀 I’m interested in all things tech like software development, app launches, web3... all things tech really. I also love music, puzzles and time out with friends.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning fullstack web development, it's really the starting point for me, who knows what could happen in the future?. It's my dream to be a full stack developer and some day work for the leading tech companies, being a part of something bigger than me.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects and help workflow, I hope to help out in any way I can. 
- 📫 I can be reached through my social media handles that will be present on my porfolio site(at this moment it's still under developement, hopefully i remember to update you when it's ready lol).
